# _data/keyword_colors.yml
# Define custom colors for keywords.
# Keywords should match the exact string as they appear in your .bib file's 'keywords' field, after stripping leading/trailing whitespace.
# For example, if your bib file has "AI Safety, LLM", you'd use:
#   "AI Safety": "#FF6347"
#   "LLM": "#4682B4"

# Add your keyword-color pairs here:
# Example:
"AI Safety": "#F09EA7"
"LLM": "#F6CA94"
"Reinforcement Learning": "#FAFABE"
"Human Intelligence": "#C1EBC0"
"Computational Modeling": "#C7CAFF"
"Method Development": "#CDABEB"
"Neuroscience": "#F6C2F3"
# Default fallback colors will be used if a keyword is not listed here.
