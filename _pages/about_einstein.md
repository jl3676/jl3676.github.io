I'm a 4th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley working with [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) at the interseciton of cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. My thesis work focuses on understanding the computational principles of human intelligence through the lens of learning and decision-making. I use computational cognitive modeling to investigate the algorithms implemented by the human brain to navigate complex, dynamic learning environments. I'm immensely interested in how humans learn complex decision structures and flexibly transfer them to solve new problems.
