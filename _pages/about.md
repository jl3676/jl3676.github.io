My research focuses on understanding *intelligence* and building *safe* AI systems. 

I'm a rising 5th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/). My thesis focuses on interpreting the computational principles of human intelligence through the lens of learning and decision-making. I use computational modeling to reverse-engineer the algorithms implemented by the human brain to navigate complex, dynamic learning environments. Particularly, I'm interested in how humans learn complex representations and flexibly transfer them to solve new problems. 

I also work on ensuring that the intelligent systems we build are safe and aligned with human values. In Summer 2025, I'm researching AI agent safety as an Applied Science Intern at [Amazon Web Services Agentic AI](https://aws.amazon.com). As a Research Intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) in Summer 2024, I led a project on improving the interpretability and transparency of the safety moderation of AI behavior.
