## RESEARCH

My research interests center on understanding _intelligence_—both natural and artificial—and building more capable and _safe_ AI models.

I'm a rising 5th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/). My thesis investigates how intelligent agents efficiently learn, reason, plan, and make decisions in complex, dynamic environments—insights I derive from modeling human behavior. My goal is to reverse-engineer these effective learning algorithms to inform the development of next-generation AI.

I'm also committed to ensuring that the AI systems we build are safe and aligned with human values. Currently, I'm researching AI agent safety as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Web Services Agentic AI](https://aws.amazon.com). Previously, as a Research Intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org), I led a project on improving the interpretability and transparency of the safety moderation of AI behavior.
