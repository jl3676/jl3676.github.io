I'm a 4th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) working at the intersection of cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. My thesis focuses on understanding the computational principles of human intelligence through the lens of learning and decision-making. I use computational cognitive modeling to reverse-engineer the algorithms implemented by the human brain to navigate complex, dynamic learning environments. Particularly, I'm interested in how humans learn complex decision structures and flexibly transfer them to solve new problems. 

I'm also passionate about AI and its intersections with cognitive science. I worked as a Research Intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org) in Summer 2024, where I led a project on improving the interpretability of LLM safety tools using an approach inspired by cognitive science. In the future, I hope to apply my knowledge about human intelligence to better understand artificial intelligence and improve the capabilities of machine learning models.
