## RESEARCH

My research is dedicated to improving the _safety_ of generative AI systems. My goal is to ensure that as AI models become more powerful, they remain robust, interpretable, and aligned with human values. I have applied this focus directly through research internships at [AWS Agentic AI](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/agentic-ai/), where I investigated the adversarial robustness of AI agents, and at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org), where I worked on interpretable and transparent safety moderation.

My approach to AI safety is grounded in cognitive science. As a final-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/), I investigate the computational principles behind how humans learn, reason, and make decisions. This background provides a unique lens for analyzing complex, human-like behaviors in AI and for constructing high-quality alignment data that reflects nuanced human judgment.
