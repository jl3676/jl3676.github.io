I'm a 4th-year PhD student at UC Berkeley advised by Professor [Anne Collins](https://ccn.studentorg.berkeley.edu/) working at the interseciton of cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. My thesis focuses on understanding the computational principles of human intelligence through the lens of learning and decision-making. I use computational cognitive modeling to investigate the algorithms implemented by the human brain to navigate complex, dynamic learning environments. Particularly, I'm interested in how humans learn complex decision structures and flexibly transfer them to solve new problems. 

I'm also passionate about AI and its intersections with cognitive science. Currently, I'm working as a research intern at the [Allen Institute for AI](https://allenai.org), where I lead a project that aims to improve the safety and interpretability of LLMs. In the future, I hope to apply my knowledge about human intelligence to better understand artificial intelligence and improve the capabilities of machine leanring models.
