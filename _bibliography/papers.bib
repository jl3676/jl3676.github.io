  title={Dynamic noise estimation: A generalized method for modeling noise fluctuations in decision-making},
  author={Li, Jing-Jing and Shi, Chengchun and Li, Lexin and Collins, Anne GE},
  abstract={Computational cognitive modeling is an important tool for understanding the processes supporting human and animal decision-making. Choice data in decision-making tasks are inherently noisy, and separating noise from signal can improve the quality of computational modeling. Common approaches to model decision noise often assume constant levels of noise or exploration throughout learning (e.g., the 
-softmax policy). However, this assumption is not guaranteed to hold – for example, a subject might disengage and lapse into an inattentive phase for a series of trials in the middle of otherwise low-noise performance. Here, we introduce a new, computationally inexpensive method to dynamically estimate the levels of noise fluctuations in choice behavior, under a model assumption that the agent can transition between two discrete latent states (e.g., fully engaged and random). Using simulations, we show that modeling noise levels dynamically instead of statically can substantially improve model fit and parameter estimation, especially in the presence of long periods of noisy behavior, such as prolonged lapses of attention. We further demonstrate the empirical benefits of dynamic noise estimation at the individual and group levels by validating it on four published datasets featuring diverse populations, tasks, and models. Based on the theoretical and empirical evaluation of the method reported in the current work, we expect that dynamic noise estimation will improve modeling in many decision-making paradigms over the static noise estimation method currently used in the modeling literature, while keeping additional model complexity and assumptions minimal.},

  title={An algorithmic account for how humans efficiently learn, transfer, and compose hierarchically structured decision policies},
  author={Li, Jing-Jing and Collins, Anne},
  abstract={Learning structures that effectively abstract decision policies is key to the flexibility of human intelligence. Previous work has shown that humans use hierarchically structured policies to efficiently navigate complex and dynamic environments. However, the computational processes that support the learning and construction of such policies remain insufficiently understood. To address this question, we tested 1,026 human participants on a decision-making task where they could learn, transfer, and recompose multiple sets of hierarchical policies. We propose a novel algorithmic account for the learning processes underlying observed human behavior. We show that humans rely on compressed policies over states in early learning, which gradually unfold into hierarchical representations via meta-learning and Bayesian inference. Our modeling evidence suggests that these hierarchical policies are structured in a temporally backward, rather than forward, fashion. Taken together, these algorithmic architectures characterize how the interplay between reinforcement learning, policy compression, meta-learning, and working memory supports structured decision-making and compositionality in a resource-rational way.},

  abstract={Absence seizures are brief episodes of impaired consciousness, behavioral arrest, and unresponsiveness, with yet-unknown neuronal mechanisms. Here we report that an awake female rat model recapitulates the behavioral, electroencephalographic, and cortical functional magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of human absence seizures. Neuronally, seizures feature overall decreased but rhythmic firing of neurons in cortex and thalamus. Individual cortical and thalamic neurons express one of four distinct patterns of seizure-associated activity, one of which causes a transient initial peak in overall firing at seizure onset, and another which drives sustained decreases in overall firing. 40–60 s before seizure onset there begins a decline in low frequency electroencephalographic activity, neuronal firing, and behavior, but an increase in higher frequency electroencephalography and rhythmicity of neuronal firing. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged brain state changes precede consciousness-impairing seizures, and that during seizures distinct functional groups of cortical and thalamic neurons produce an overall transient firing increase followed by a sustained firing decrease, and increased rhythmicity.}

  title={Credit assignment in hierarchical option transfer},
  author={Li, Jing-Jing and Xia, Liyu and Dong, Flora and Collins, Anne GE},
  abstract={Humans have the exceptional ability to efficiently structure past knowledge during learning to enable fast generalization. Xia and Collins (2021) evaluated this ability in a hierarchically structured, sequential decision-making task, where participants could build “options” (strategy “chunks”) at multiple levels of temporal and state abstraction. A quantitative model, the Option Model, captured the transfer effects observed in human participants, suggesting that humans create and compose hierarchical options and use them to explore novel contexts. However, it is not well understood how learning in a new context is attributed to new and old options (i.e., the credit assignment problem). In a new context with new contingencies, where participants can recompose some aspects of previously learned options, do they reliably create new options or overwrite existing ones? Does the credit assignment depend on how similar the new option is to an old one? In our experiment, two groups of participants (n=124 and n=104) learned hierarchically structured options, experienced different amounts of negative transfer in a new option context, and were subsequently tested on the previously learned options. Behavioral analysis showed that old options were successfully reused without interference, and new options were appropriately created and credited. This credit assignment did not depend on how similar the new option was to the old option, showing great flexibility and precision in human hierarchical learning. These behavioral results were captured by the Option Model, providing further evidence for option learning and transfer in humans.},
